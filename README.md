  * **Speaker Topic #1 - Supercharge your Python Development Environment with VS Code**
  * Speaker: Dawn Wages
  * VS Code is a free code editor, built on open source, runs everywhere, and is made to be extensible for your development environment. Regardless of your workflow, you're able to modify your Python supporting tools and extensions so you can focus on the code. This talk is broken up into three sections: features for collaboration, code editing, and content creation.
  * VS Code supports the open specification for Dev Containers which lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. You can open any folder or repository inside the container and take advantage of all the features in Visual Studio Code starting with a devcontainer.json. I'll show you how to create a Dev Container, how to share it, and the ways that it expedites the process of jumping into a new project, quickly making a change, and proposing a PR. In this Dev Container, I'll show some of my favorite extensions for code development including but not limited to: ruff the Python linter, Black the Python formatter, Jupyter notebooks, and Python extension IntelliSense. And finally, I'll show you how these specifications, as well as some options for UI, can make it easier to give demos, stream, teach or just make your IDE pretty.

  * **Speaker Topic #2 - Data Science & Canadian Elections**
  * Speaker: Kevin H. Shu
  * The last two Canadian federal elections have resulted in a situation where the party that wins the most seats (and forms government) does not have a plurality of the popular vote. This has renewed calls for change away from the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. This talk aims to examine hypothetical federal results over time if FPTP were changed to two party-list based forms of Proportional Representation at the regional or provincial level.
